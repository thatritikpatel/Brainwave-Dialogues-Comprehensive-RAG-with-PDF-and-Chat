## üöÄ Why This Project?

In today's data-driven world, retrieving context-aware and relevant information is crucial for making informed decisions. Traditional document retrieval and conversational systems often fall short in:

1. Understanding complex context across multiple documents.
2. Maintaining conversational history effectively.
3. Ensuring fast and accurate answers from large collections of text.

**Brainwave Dialogues** bridges these gaps by combining advanced RAG techniques with PDF document processing to provide intelligent, context-aware conversational experiences.

## ü§î What is Brainwave Dialogues?

This application integrates **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface and **LangChain**'s robust RAG components. It processes PDF documents, extracts meaningful data, and enables conversational interactions using high-performance LLMs like `gemma2-9b-it` via ChatGroq. Key features include:

- Context-aware question answering.
- Support for multi-turn dialogues with memory.
- High-speed retrieval from large PDF datasets.
- Embedding-based document understanding using HuggingFace.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

### Workflow
1. **Document Loading**: 
   - PDFs are processed using `PyPDFLoader`.
   - Content is split into manageable chunks via `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

2. **Embedding Creation**: 
   - Text is embedded using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` for semantic understanding.

3. **Document Indexing**:
   - Indexed using `Chroma` for efficient retrieval.

4. **Conversation Management**:
   - Utilizes `ChatMessageHistory` for maintaining conversational context.

5. **Answer Generation**:
   - RAG pipeline integrates with `ChatGroq` to answer queries with both retrieval and generation capabilities.
